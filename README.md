## Cinemagoria

> A community-oriented film & TV discovery platform.
> Lead developer: [@imprvhub](https://github.com/imprvhub) · In active development since March 27, 2024.

![Cinemagoria Cover](https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset1.webp)

Cinemagoria aggregates metadata, ratings, reviews, festival coverage, awards history, streaming availability and original soundtracks from **IMDb, TMDB, MusicBrainz, Trakt.tv, Rotten Tomatoes, JustWatch and MDBList** into a single deeply integrated experience — with full user accounts, public profiles, watchlists, custom lists and a follow-based notification system.

The platform is built around four principles:

- **Aggregation over exclusivity** — no in-house catalog; trusted third-party sources only.
- **Festival-first discovery** — dedicated coverage of major international film festivals.
- **Personalization without lock-in** — public/private profiles, custom lists, transparent controls with granular cookie consent management.
- **Performance as a feature** — pre-computed data, server-side selection, concurrent fetching.

## N.O.I.R. — The Cinemagoria Selection

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset11.webp" alt="N.O.I.R. — Nothing Out Is Ready" width="70%">
</div>

**N.O.I.R. (Nothing Out Is Ready)** is Cinemagoria's in-house editorial selection — a parallel content layer to the algorithmic feeds, covering titles released or scheduled from 2024 onwards. Curation is forward-looking: upcoming premieres are added well in advance, with the current selection reaching as far as March 2027.

**Two states, one badge.** A title in N.O.I.R. lives in one of two states:

- **`hero_selections`** — actively rotating in the homepage marquee rendered by `Hero.vue` (`pages/index.vue`). These are the titles Cinemagoria is currently promoting for cultural value and editorial alignment.
- **`/noir` archive** — where titles move once they exit the active rotation. Nothing is ever removed; rotating out is a state transition into the historical record. The page also exposes a `?` trigger that opens the N.O.I.R. manifesto.

The N.O.I.R. badge — rendered in the top-right corner of each backdrop in `Hero.vue` — applies in both states, so any title Cinemagoria has ever editorially promoted stays identifiable wherever it appears across the platform.

**Data pipeline.** A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow keeps the N.O.I.R. dataset (titles, enrichment data, rotation state) in sync with the curatorial source so additions and state transitions propagate without manual deploys.

## Features

### Film Festivals
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset9.webp" alt="Festivals" width="70%">
</div>

Every covered festival gets its own page, API endpoints, card and badge components, and a slot in the homepage carousel. Selections are grouped by the festival's real sections, screening schedules are timezone-aware, and award winners are seeded once the ceremonies close.

**Live now**

**Sundance** · **Rotterdam** · **Berlinale** · **Romford Horror** · **Slamdance** · **SXSW** · **BIFFF** · **BAFICI** · **CUFF** *(Calgary Underground)* · **Cannes** · **Tribeca** · **BIFAN** *(Bucheon)* · **KVIFF** *(Karlovy Vary)* · **Fantasia** *(Montréal)* · **Locarno** · **FrightFest** *(London)* · **Venice** *(La Biennale)* · **TIFF** *(Toronto)* · **BIFF** *(Busan)* · **BFI London** · **Sitges**

**Still to land in the 2026 cycle**

**Cairo** · **Mar del Plata** · **BARS** *(Buenos Aires Rojo Sangre)* · **Marrakech** · **Red Sea**

Cairo, Marrakech and Red Sea take coverage into Africa and the Middle East. The 2027 cycle adds **Göteborg**.

Cannes ships the official screenings plus the parallel sections — Critics' Week, Quinzaine des Cinéastes and ACID — and Venice carries its own parallel sections. FrightFest ships the full official screening schedule, and Berlinale adds an interactive timezone-aware view of it. The hero section supports multiple simultaneous festival premiere badges with display precedence.

**Coverage runs from 2026 onwards** and continues across each subsequent edition. Each integration is planned against the festival's lineup announcement rather than a fixed countdown to opening night, since nothing can be ingested before the programme is public — the delivery plan is tracked on the [Festivals Coverage Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/cinemagoria/projects/1). A festival is dropped when its selection largely duplicates coverage already shipped.

> **Catalog coverage caveat:** festival pages are built from public metadata and third-party sources, which don't always cover every title — particularly short films, experimental works and regional productions. This is a technical limitation, not an editorial decision. No film is intentionally omitted or censored; gaps narrow as upstream metadata catches up.

### Release Calendar
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset12.webp" alt="Release Calendar" width="70%">
</div>

A public calendar at `/calendar` with every release the platform tracks for a given month or week — films and episodes together, drawn from the curated catalog (festival programmes, N.O.I.R.). A release date belongs to a country and a format, so every entry names its territory and release type instead of presenting one date as universal. A title's festival itinerary stays expanded, while a wide same-week international rollout collapses into a single entry. Lens, territory, media type and free-text filters run client-side over one cacheable payload per month.

### Search & Discovery
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset10.webp" alt="Search" width="70%">
</div>

Categorized multi-search across movies, TV shows, people, news, festivals and production companies — visually separated by category through horizontal carousels. Contextual query parsing extracts year and person signals to score results by relevance, with a built-in search guide modal for best practices. Supports direct IMDb / TMDb ID lookup, embedded Discover filters and Rust-backed typo detection.

### Catalog Discovery
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset2.webp" alt="Discover" width="70%">
</div>

A unified Discover component embedded directly in Movie and TV pages: granular content filters, IMDb and user rating ranges, item enrichment with chunking, and chip-based active filter display.

### Awards
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset6.webp" alt="Awards" width="70%">
</div>

Full historical coverage of the Academy Awards, Golden Globes, Palme d'Or, Golden Lion and Golden Bear, with festival winners archived as each covered edition closes. Includes a dedicated Awards page, per-title and per-person awards tabs, and intelligent link resolution that routes to the correct movie or TV page even when TMDb IDs collide.

### Movie & TV Detail
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset8.webp" alt="Detail Pages" width="70%">
</div>

IMDb-first ratings with TMDB fallback (always labeled), Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer, MusicBrainz original soundtracks, Trakt.tv reviews, release status context, country-flagged release dates, and tab-based recommendation carousels (Similar / By the Director / By the Producer / By the Creator). External links render conditionally — never broken.

### Watchlist & Custom Lists
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset4.webp" alt="Watchlist" width="70%">
</div>

A 50-movie + 50-TV watchlist with persistent filters (genre, year, IMDb rating range, votes, personal rating) and Bayesian-weighted sorting. Unlimited custom themed lists with descriptions, public/private toggles, cloning of public lists, dynamic SEO, and bulk multi-select actions with undo. The global QuickFav dropdown manages list membership from any content card.

### Follows & Notifications
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset3.webp" alt="Notifications" width="70%">
</div>

Follow people (actors, directors, writers), TV shows, production companies and streaming platforms. A `/cron/check-releases` job detects new films (±30 days for people) and new episodes (±7 days for TV), pushing rich notifications synced across devices via Turso. The notification center supports filtering, bulk mark-all-read, paginated browsing and per-item deletion with ownership validation.

### Cinema News
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://ivanluna.dev/images/assets/cinemagoria-asset5.webp" alt="News" width="70%">
</div>

Cinemagoria runs its own editorial pipeline for cinema news, alongside a curated set of trusted outlets — every card is labeled with its source, first-party articles open in-app and third-party ones link out to the publisher. Article pages feature YouTube trailer embeds, multi-asset image carousels, and related TMDB movies, TV shows and people for discoverability. The frontend reads pre-computed results from Turso (sub-50ms load times), with article search scoped to Cinemagoria articles, saved articles, an RSS feed for Cinemagoria-sourced content and a homepage news carousel.

### Authentication

Modal-based auth (no `/login` or `/register` pages) with Google OAuth backed by Django REST Framework, queued pending actions that resume after sign-in, event-driven session updates, and DOMPurify-protected user content. Account deletion is fully self-service.

## Additional Capabilities

- **Public user profiles** with activity feeds, follower/following management and configurable privacy.
- **Granular media progress tracking** in real minutes for films and down to individual episodes for TV, editable from the hero and surfaced as progress bars on cards.
- **Production company & streaming platform pages** with dedicated content listings, sorting, follow buttons and "Explore All" entry points.
- **Server-side hero selection** with quality gating (IMDb origin, score > 7.0, > 5,000 votes, animation/fantasy excluded) and a promise-based Map cache for enrichment.
- **Open access** to festival hubs, the release calendar, the N.O.I.R. archive, and more— no sign-in required.
- **Internationalization** in English and Español via subdomain switching, with AI-delegated translation for hero overviews.

## Architecture Highlights

- **Concurrent fetching everywhere** — `Promise.all` for homepage data, awards and hero APIs; `Promise.allSettled` for provider and review fetching.
- **Edge caching on Movie, TV and root routes** — route rules emit `Cache-Control` only and the CDN stores the response; Nitro's server-side cache is deliberately never enabled, since its default in-memory driver leaks heap on wildcard routes. CSR is preserved for interactive routes like `/search`.
- **News and awards decoupled from request time** — pre-curated by background workers, read instantly at request time.
- **Release calendar as one normalized payload per month** — title metadata serialized once and referenced by events, backed by an indexed range query on an event-grain release dataset synced by a scheduled job.
- **Query profiling at the database client boundary** — every server-side query is timed and aggregated by shape.
- **Dynamic, split sitemap generation** via server routes for SEO.
- **`fetchWithRefill` carousel batching** with seen-ID deduplication and diversity capping.
- **Hero enrichment override system** (`force_enrichment`, `_forcePoster`, `_forceBackdrop`, `_forceTrailer` mixins) for precise control over featured assets.
- **Standardized utilities** — `mapItemToDbPayload`, `itemMapper`, `getPosterUrl`, `formatDate`, `handleImageError` — to keep payloads and rendering consistent across components.
